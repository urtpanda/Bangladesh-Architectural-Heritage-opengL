# Bangladesh Architectural Heritage Visualization (OpenGL)
A 2D OpenGL simulation of Bangladesh’s iconic landmarks with animated day/night transitions, including National Martyrs’ Monument, National Parliament, and Shaheed Minar, featuring natural elements, moving objects, and interactive scenes.


## Overview
This project is a **2D Computer Graphics simulation** of Bangladesh's iconic landmarks using **OpenGL**. It showcases **animated day and night versions** of the landmarks with natural and interactive elements, creating a dynamic and visually engaging experience.

## Features
- National Martyrs' Monument (Jatiyo Sriti Soudho)
Day Version: Blue sky, bright sun, clouds, birds flying, green trees, and Bangladesh flag waving.
